For a quite long time, I was bugged by a weird behaviour of my Windows: If I launch Minecraft Server along with the Client, it's very likely that my Windows PC will go BSOD, like 9 times out of 10.

Assuming it's just caused by my about 5 years old PC (Just 5? what the heck!?), I had never really dig into it (Now I think about it, as a developer I get disappointed about myself) until the day that I am really feel annoyed.

I took a look at the BSOD error message, noted down the .dll name, then restart the PC then tried to google it. It turned out it's **Wise System Monitor** which I installed in 2018.

Well, I recalled I had installed it, but could not think of any time I used it. It had been silently living in my OS, monitoring stuff I run, to an extent that it's interfering how Windows access my files.

Uninstall. Problem solved.

So better keep tabs on what you installed.
